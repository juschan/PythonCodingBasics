    ## Background
    ]

    .content-right-column[
    * Created by Guido Van Rossum - Python's **Benovelent Dictator for Life**

    * First released in 1991 as a successor to ABC programming language 

    * Emphasis on code readability

    * Characteristics:
      * indentation for code blocks
      * dynamically-typed and implicit
      * garbage-collected
      * comprehensive standard library - 'batteries included'
      * multiple programming paradigms: 
          * procedural
          * object-oriented
          * functional 

    * Latest major version is Python 3.0 (released 2008)
    * May encounter Python 2.7 codebases (to support older libraries)

    ## Exercise: 4 ways to run Python
    ]
    
    .content-left-column[
    1. Interactive interpreter - Open "Anaconda Prompt"
      ```
      cd d:
      mkdir testbed
      cd testbed
      python
      >>> print("Hello World")
      >>> exit()
      ```
    
    2. IDE - Open Spyder
      * Create demo1.py file and save in 'testbed' folder
      * run all lines and separate lines
      * Variable explorer
    
    3. CLI script - Open "Anaconda Prompt" and navigate to 'testbed' folder
      ```
      python demo1.py
      ```
    
    4. Jupyter Notebook - Open "Anaconda Prompt" and navigate to 'testbed' folder
      ```
      jupyter notebook
      ```

    .content-right-column[
    Next steps in your learning:

    * Take up a course (eg. NUS-ISS, Udemy)

    * Explore the documentation, online examples, get a Python book from the library
    
    * Apply Python in a project (eg. convert Excel to Python using pandas library)
      * Speak to me if you need some direction, although I can't do the work for you!

    * Join Python User Group and attend Python Meetups
      * Make some noise if you want it held in Tampines!

    * Provide feedback:
      * Microsoft Forms - Feedback for slides
      * Python User Group Workplace - post your comments!
      * Write to the team (myself, Michelle, Theresa)

    * Write to my bosses :)
